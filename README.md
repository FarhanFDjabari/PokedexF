## Architecture

**Pokedex F** is based on the BLoC architecture that implements the Repository pattern, which follows the [Official BLoC architecture documentation](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/architecture)

![architecture](figures/figure1.jpeg)

The overall architecture of this app is composed of Presentation/App layer, Domain layer, and Data layer. Each layer has its dedicated components and responsibilities.

### Presentation / App Layer

Presentation / App layer consists of UI elements such as widgets to configure screens that can interact with the users and state management BLoC as app logic and states holder.

### Domain Layer

Domain layer consists of core elements that are related to the business processes of the app. These elements include business data (entities) and business logic (use cases), as well as the abstraction of repository objects that communicate with other layers to obtain data from data sources and provide it to the users.

### Data Layer

Data layer consists of the repository implementation and the data sources, which include local (database) and remote (API) data sources. This layer communicates with the domain layer to send response data to the presentation layer using the Dependency Inversion Principle.

## REST API

Pokedex using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) for constructing RESTful API.<br>
PokeAPI provides a RESTful API interface to highly detailed objects built from thousands of lines of data related to Pok√©mon.

## Installation Guide

- Check if the flutter SDK and the version is v3.7.3 or higher. [Instruction to change flutter channel](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Flutter-build-release-channels#how-to-change-channels).

- Clone the repo

  ```sh

  git clone https://github.com/FarhanFDjabari/PokedexF.git

  ```

- Get the pubspec packages

  ```sh
  flutter pub get
  ```

- Some files like `*.freezed.dart`, `*.g.dart` are auto generated. If there is any issue from these files just run this command to regenerate them.

  ```sh
  flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
  ```

- Run the app

  ```sh
  flutter run
  ```
